    return `You are writing a comprehensive summary of a YouTube video that will be posted as a comment. Output ONLY the summary content itself - no preamble, no meta-commentary, no introductions like "Here's a summary" or "This is a breakdown". Start directly with the content.

Video information:

Channel: ${videoInfo.channel || 'Unknown'}
URL: ${videoInfo.url || 'Unknown'}
Duration: ${videoInfo.duration || 'Unknown'}
${chunkNote}

Raw YouTube transcript data:
${transcript}

WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write naturally like a human, not an AI
- Use simple, clear English (Grade 10-12 reading level)
- Write in third person perspective (e.g., "This video covers...", "${channelName} explains...", "The creator discusses...")
- Refer to the channel/creator by name when relevant: "${channelName} is saying..." or "${channelName} mentions..."
- NO AI-sounding words: avoid "delve", "leverage", "moreover", "furthermore", "comprehensive", "robust", "utilize", "facilitate", "elucidate", "here's the kicker"
- Sound conversational and genuine

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ## for section headers (e.g., ## Key Points, ## Main Takeaways)
- Use - for bullet points (not ‚Ä¢ or other symbols)
- Include timestamps in [MM:SS] or [HH:MM:SS] format for every relevant point
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) where appropriate
- Use simple, classy emojis sparingly (‚úì, ‚Üí, ‚è∞, üìå, etc.)
- NO markdown styling like **bold** or *italic*
- Keep formatting clean and easy to read

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Cover ALL important points from the video - don't limit yourself to a specific number
- If the video has steps (how-to), include ALL steps with timestamps
- If the video is a listicle, include ALL list items with timestamps
- If the video has key concepts, include ALL of them with explanations
- Include direct quotes when impactful
- Highlight important statistics, facts, or data points
- Add actionable takeaways where relevant
- Ensure every major point has a timestamp

STRUCTURE:
Organize the summary logically based on the video content. The structure should adapt to the video type:
- For how-to videos: Step-by-step breakdown with timestamps
- For listicles: Complete list with all items
- For educational content: Main concepts with explanations
- For discussions: Key points and arguments made

CRITICAL: Output ONLY the summary content. Do NOT write "Here's a summary" or "This is a breakdown" or any meta-commentary. Start immediately with the content (e.g., start with a ## header or the first point).`;
