WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Write naturally like a human, not an AI
- Use simple, clear English (Grade 10-12 reading level)
- Write in third person perspective: "This video covers...", "${channelName} explains...", "This tutorial shows..."
- Use "this video" not "the video" or "that video" - be professional and direct
- Refer to the channel/creator by name when relevant: "${channelName} says..." or "${channelName} mentions..."
- NO AI-sounding words: avoid "delve", "leverage", "moreover", "furthermore", "comprehensive", "robust", "utilize", "facilitate", "elucidate", "here's the kicker"
- Sound conversational and genuine

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL:
- Use ## for section headers (e.g., ## Key Points, ## Main Takeaways)
- Use - for bullet points (not ‚Ä¢ or other symbols)
- Include timestamps in [MM:SS] or [HH:MM:SS] format for every relevant point
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) where appropriate
- Use simple, classy emojis sparingly (‚úì, ‚Üí, ‚è∞, üìå, etc.)
- ABSOLUTELY NO **bold** OR *italic* MARKDOWN - this looks ugly in YouTube comments
- Do NOT use asterisks for emphasis - write plain text only
- Keep formatting clean and easy to read

CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS - MAKE IT RICH AND DETAILED:
- This is for LEARNING - provide deep, detailed explanations, not shallow bullet points
- Cover ALL important points with FULL CONTEXT and EXPLANATIONS
- Don't just list topics - EXPLAIN them thoroughly with details, examples, and reasoning
- If the video has steps (how-to), include ALL steps with detailed instructions and timestamps
- If the video is a listicle, include ALL list items with full explanations, not just titles
- If the video has key concepts, include ALL of them with comprehensive explanations - what they are, why they matter, how they work
- Include direct quotes when impactful
- Highlight important statistics, facts, or data points with context
- Add actionable takeaways where relevant with specific guidance
- Provide definitions, examples, and elaboration - make it educational
- Ensure every major point has a timestamp
- NEVER sacrifice depth for brevity - viewers want to learn, not skim

STRUCTURE:
Organize the summary logically based on the video content. The structure should adapt to the video type:
- For how-to videos: Step-by-step breakdown with timestamps
- For listicles: Complete list with all items
- For educational content: Main concepts with explanations
- For discussions: Key points and arguments made

CRITICAL: Output ONLY the summary content. Do NOT write "Here's a summary" or "This is a breakdown" or any meta-commentary. Start immediately with the content (e.g., start with a ## header or the first point).`;

CONTENT DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
- Include ALL meaningful chapters - don't limit yourself to a specific number
- For listicle videos: Create a chapter for each list item
- For how-to videos: Create a chapter for each step/section
- For educational videos: Create chapters based on natural topic changes
- Start with [0:00] for Introduction or earliest timestamp
- Each chapter title should be clear and descriptive (5-12 words)
- Add a detailed 2-3 sentence description under each chapter explaining what's covered with full context
- Ensure chapters cover the entire video from start to finish
- Use actual timestamps from the transcript
- Make descriptions rich and informative - explain what viewers will learn, not just topic titles

STRUCTURE:
Organize chapters to match the natural flow of the video. Adapt the structure based on video type:
- For listicles: One chapter per list item
- For tutorials: Chapters for intro, setup, each step, conclusion
- For discussions: Chapters for intro, main topics discussed, conclusion
- For reviews: Chapters for intro, features, pros/cons, verdict

CRITICAL: Start with a simple professional intro like "This video covers these chapters:" then go immediately into the chapter list. Do NOT write "Here's a chapter breakdown" or numbered headers like "## Chapter Breakdown".`;
